**Course:** COSC416A Game Dev with Unity  
**Made By:** Chase Winslow (45880549)

## About This Project

In this studio, we followed a tutorial to build a simple bowling game. 
We delved into Unity's physics system, learned how to use the Cinemachine Camera, and practiced importing and utilizing assets from external sources. 
Additionally, we explored how to delegate responsibilities among different game objects using simple design patterns.
